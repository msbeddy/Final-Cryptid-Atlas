        <h3>The Lochness Monster</h3>
        <p>Deep in the dark waters of Loch Ness in Scotland, people say a large, mysterious creature lives far below the waves. 
          It is quiet and hard to see, only appearing for a moment before slipping back into the deep. Some call it Nessie, and believe it has lived in the lake for hundreds, 
          maybe even thousands of years. Many have tried to find proof, but Nessie remains one of the world’s biggest water mysteries.</p> 
    <div id="accordion">
  <h3>🧠 Origin & Legends</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The Loch Ness Monster comes from Scotland, a country known for its misty hills, old castles, and deep lakes called lochs. People living near Loch Ness, 
      a long lake in the Scottish Highlands, have told stories about a strange creature in the water for many centuries. 
      Some of the earliest legends come from the Picts, one of the oldest cultures in Scotland, who carved pictures of mysterious water animals on stones. 
      Later, stories were passed down by Scottish families who believed the creature might be a water guardian, a spirit that watched over the lake. 
      Over time, visitors and explorers shared the story with the rest of the world, and the creature became known as the Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie.</p>

  <h3>🧾 Physical Description</h3>
  <div>
    <p>People who say they have seen the Loch Ness Monster describe it as very large, with a long neck, a small head, and a big, rounded body. 
      Some say it has flippers like a sea animal, while others say it moves like a giant snake. 
      Nessie is usually described as dark in color so it blends in with the deep, shadowy water. 
      Because the lake is so dark, the creature is very hard to see clearly.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>👣 Sightings</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster have been reported for hundreds of years. The most famous sightings happen in Loch Ness, a very long, very deep lake in Scotland. 
      People have claimed to see a shape rising out of the water, ripples moving with no boat around, or a long neck sticking up before slipping away. 
      Many people have taken photos or videos, but most are blurry or unclear, which keeps the mystery alive. Scientists have searched the lake many times, 
      but Nessie remains hidden.</p>
