        <h3>El Chupacabra</h3>
        <p>The Chupacabra is a mysterious creature said to wander through farms and fields at night. 
          Its name comes from Spanish and means “goat-sucker,” because it is known for drinking the blood of animals. 
          It is quiet, fast, and rarely seen, which makes many people wonder if it is real or just a story told in the dark. 
          Whether creature or legend, the Chupacabra remains one of the strangest mysteries in modern folklore.</p> 
    <div id="accordion">
  <h3>🧠 Origin & Legends</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Stories of the Chupacabra began in Puerto Rico in the 1990s, when farmers found animals with strange marks and no clear explanation. 
      The legend spread quickly across Latin America, especially in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil, and later into the southern United States. 
      Some say the Chupacabra is a new creature never seen before. Others believe it is an escaped lab experiment, a spirit animal, or even a creature from folklore that 
      finally showed itself. Many communities tell the story as a warning to keep animals safe at night.</p>

  <h3>🧾 Physical Description</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Descriptions of the Chupacabra can be very different depending on who is telling the story. 
      In Puerto Rico, it is usually described as a small, strange creature with gray or green skin, large red eyes, spines down its back, and claws. 
      In some parts of the United States and Mexico, people say it looks more like a wild dog or coyote, but with thin fur, sharp teeth, and a bony body. 
      Both versions are known for being fast, silent, and active at night.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>👣 Sightings</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Sightings of the Chupacabra have been reported in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Texas, and other parts of the American Southwest. 
      People usually report finding attacked animals such as goats, chickens, or sheep. 
      Some witnesses say they saw a small, hunched creature with glowing eyes moving through the dark. 
      Others say they saw a thin, dog-like shape running quickly and disappearing into bushes or trees. Many of these sightings are shared by farmers, ranchers, 
      and travelers who spend time outdoors at night.</p>
