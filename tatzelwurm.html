        <h3>Tatzelwurm</h3>
        <p>High in the snowy mountains of the Alps, people tell stories about a secret creature called the Tatzelwurm. It is said to hide among rocks, caves, and 
          thick forests, only coming out when the world is quiet. Quick and shy, the Tatzelwurm is rarely seen for more than a moment. 
          Some describe it as strange and spooky, while others think it is simply a mountain creature trying to stay hidden from people.</p> 
    <div id="accordion">
  <h3>🧠 Origin & Legends</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The legend of the Tatzelwurm comes from the Alps, a mountain range in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy. For hundreds of years, travelers, shepherds, 
      and hunters in these regions have told stories of a long, lizard-like creature living deep in the mountains. Some old tales say it is a mountain spirit that 
      guards the land. Others believe it is a real animal that is very rare and very good at hiding. 
      These stories are passed down through families and villages, especially in places close to forests and cliffs.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>🧾 Physical Description</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The Tatzelwurm is usually described as having a long, snake-like body with two short front legs. Its skin is smooth like a lizard’s, 
      and its tail can be long and curling. Many stories say the creature has a cat-like face, with large eyes that seem to watch closely. 
      Some say it is only a few feet long, while others describe it as much bigger. 
      Because no one has seen it clearly for very long, descriptions change from story to story.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>👣 Sightings</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Sightings of the Tatzelwurm have been reported mostly in the Alps, especially in Switzerland and Austria. 
      People hiking or working in the mountains have said they saw a quick, snake-shaped creature move between rocks or across a snowy path. 
      Some claim they found strange tracks that look like a long body sliding with small footprints in front. 
      Because the mountains are large and full of hidden spaces, it is easy to imagine creatures living there that humans rarely see.</p>
