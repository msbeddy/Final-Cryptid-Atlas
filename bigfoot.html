        <h3>Bigfoot</h3>
        <p>Deep in the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest, Bigfoot roams the woods — quiet, shy, and a little bit curious. 
            Though rarely seen, this gentle giant is a favorite in cryptid folklore and loves the sound of rustling leaves beneath his enormous feet.</p>

  <h3>🧠 Origin & Legends</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Stories of Bigfoot go back centuries, inspired by Indigenous legends about large, hairy forest dwellers who lived in harmony with nature. 
        Modern sightings began in the mid-1900s, when mysterious footprints were found near logging camps.</p>

  <h3>🧾 Physical Description</h3>

    <p>Bigfoot is said to stand between 7 to 10 feet tall, covered in thick brown hair with long arms and enormous footprints (some over 16 inches long!). 
        Despite his size, many describe him as gentle and intelligent.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>👣 Sightings</h3>
