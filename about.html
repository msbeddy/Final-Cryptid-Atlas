        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting The Cryptid Library! Our goal was to create a friendly place to explore stories of mysterious creatures from around the world. 
          This website invites curious minds to imagine, discover and wonder. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always loved folklore. When I became a parent, I wanted to share that same sense of wonder with my own children.
So I created this website as a place where all children (and grown-ups too!) can enjoy learning about cryptids in an exciting and safe way.

         Jackie has loved reading since she was a child. Her favorite genres as a young adult were science fiction and fantasy. With this project, 
         Jackie combines her love of storytelling and art to help keep cryptids and the magic of folklore alive. She also loves video games and visiting museums with her kids.</p>

          Crystal began drawing at an early age and could often be found with a sketchbook and pencil in her hands. 
          When she got older, she began to get interested in space, wondering if intelligent life was out there. 
          Her room became decorated with many alien themed collectibles over the years.
