        <h3>Werewolf</h3>
        <p>On nights when the full moon shines bright, people say the werewolf comes out to roam. 
          It looks like a mix between a person and a wolf, moving through the trees where it is dark and quiet. 
          Some believe the werewolf is someone who is cursed and wants to stay hidden. Others think it guards the forest at night. 
          When you hear a long, echoing howl in the distance, some folks whisper that it might be the werewolf calling out to the moon. Whether feared or admired, 
          the werewolf remains one of the most mysterious figures to ever stalk the moonlit woods.</p>

  <h3>🧠 Origin & Legends</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Stories about werewolves have been told for a very long time, in many different countries.
      Many old stories come from Europe, where people once thought wolves were powerful, mysterious animals. 
Over time, these stories traveled and changed, becoming the werewolf legends we know today. In most legends, a werewolf is a person who can change into a wolf or a wolf-like creature. Some tales say this happens during a full moon, while others say it can happen at any time. 
Long ago, people believed that magic, curses, or being bitten by another werewolf could cause the change.</p>

  <h3>🧾 Physical Description</h3>
  <div>
    <p>A werewolf is usually shown as a creature that looks part human and part wolf. It stands on two legs like a person, but is covered in fur and has sharp claws and long teeth. 
      Its ears are pointed, and its eyes often shine brightly in the dark. Some stories say the werewolf is very strong and fast, 
      able to run through the forest without making a sound. When it moves, it looks wild and powerful, like a wolf that still remembers what it was like to be human.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>👣 Sightings</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Sightings of werewolves are part of many cultures around the world. 
      In Europe, especially in places like France, Germany, and Eastern Europe, old stories tell of wolves seen near villages and deep forests. 
      In North America, some people say they have seen large, wolf-like creatures in wooded areas, mountains, and quiet country roads. 
      A few tales from South America describe a werewolf-like creature connected to family curses or old magic.<br>

Most sightings happen at night, especially during a bright moon. People report seeing a tall, wolf-shaped figure moving quickly through trees or fields. Others say they have heard long, haunting howls with no animal in sight. Some claim they have caught a glimpse of glowing eyes watching from the shadows. These stories are often shared between families and friends, keeping the legend alive.</p>
